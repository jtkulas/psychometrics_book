## Testing

This is a book created from r markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

```{r}
library(fontawesome)

1 + 1
```

### Sub

The script used to generate this document is called `temp.qmd` and is located within the repository linked in the upper-right hand corner (hit the `r fa("github")` symbol).  

## Example

This silliness itself was generated during a 3/15/24 [LiveStream on `r fa("youtube", fill="red")`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PSr2B_9zlA).

Pretty picture as seen in @fig-heya

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Bunch of jibberish"
#| label: fig-heya
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-annotations: hover 


library(psych) 
library(plotly)

data(bfi)                                        #<1>

bfi$jibberish <- rowMeans(bfi[1:10], na.rm=TRUE)
bfi$gobbleyjook <- rowMeans(bfi[11:20], na.rm=TRUE)

plot_ly(bfi, x = ~jibberish, y = ~gobbleyjook, text = ~age, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', color=~gender,
        marker = list(size = ~age, opacity = 0.5))
```

1. This calls out the data

## Look for these

When you see this, it means there is a tip
